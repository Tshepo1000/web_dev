			<p>I live in a joint family. There are a total of seven members in my family including my mother, father, sister, brother and nephew. 
			Both my parents are retired. My brother and sister are working and my nephew is in pre school.

			All members of my family love and respect each other. We all like spending time with each other. 
			Every night after having dinner we sit together for a while to spend quality time and during this time period we talk and watch television simultaneously. 
			On the weekends we plan outings as well.</p>
